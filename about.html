        <h1>Hi, I am Youngmin Kim.<br><br>
        I graduated from Handong Global University in Feb 2015 where I majored in Visual Communication Design, Products Design, and Business management. During my undergraduate, I tried to design things that could influence people's lifestyles and behaviors. I wanted my work to improve people's lives rather than merely having an aesthetically good layout and delivering visual information. In 2014, I conducted an infographic campaign project named Litterati Korea for the Graduate Exhibition. This campaign aimed at saving the Earth by reducing litter on the streets and recycling garbage at home. Through this campaign, I started to think about how to interact with people with my design.<br><br>

        After I graduated, I joined a startup, Cardoc, which provides car repair and maintenance service with a mobile application. I was an interaction designer for almost 4 years. I used to collaborate with developers and planners pursuing making better products for users. I am skillful in Sketch, Adobe programs, Zepin, InVision and rapid prototyping. I am very strategic and analytical in any circumstances to find the best route when it comes to working in the team.
